# Finest Bot

Finest Bot is a lightweight general purpose discord bot written in python using the nextcord package.

## Installation

```
git clone github.com/enriktigasna/finest-bot && cd finest-bot 
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

⚠WARNING⚠, AFTER CLONING, DO 
```
git update-index --assume-unchanged config.json
```

THIS IS SO THAT YOUR AUTHENTICATION TOKEN DOESN'T ACCIDENTALLY GET COMMITED

## Usage

To set it up just edit the config.json and then you can run FinstBot.py. Ouput should look something like this
